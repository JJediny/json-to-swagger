# AnyJSON

A simple tool to parse JSON schema to Swagger YAML Schema, this project initiated because I exhausted of converting json to Swagger :3, I try to automate that.

## Dev Setup

- Go

## How To Use

- Open main.go files
- Edit exampleData variable
- Run with go run main.go
- The result will show on the screen and save in your clipboard

## Roadmap

- Make it work for multiple level of json schema
- Tuning CLI tools
- Make Swagger parser as a Library

## Limitations

- Only work for 2 level json and array
